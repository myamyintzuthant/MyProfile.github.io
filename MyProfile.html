<h1><font color="green"> Interest in IT (Information Technology) </h1>

<ul>
<li>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?
    Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?
    Outline your IT experience (if any)
<br> </br>
  IT is an emerging trend and there are many job opportunities in this field.
  My interest in IT aside from a job option lies in the fact that in the 21st
  century computers are a part of everyday life. I believed it was important for
  my future that I learned how to best operate and use them. I sadly do not have
  any experience in IT other than a compulsory class back in my high school were
  we were taught about computing as a subject. The class did not go into detail
  about programming or teach us about the languages so RMIT is my first real
  experience with computers.
</li>
<li>
  Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
<br> </br>
  I heard about RMIT from OUA (Open Universities Australia).
</li>
<li>
  What do you expect to learn during your studies?
<br> </br>
  I expect to learn programming languages and how to create servers, programs
  and other IT related skills.

Software Developer

<br> </br>
The position would allow me work globally meeting new individuals and work
alongside them. It will be a great learning experience and I will be able to
increase the range of my network. This makes the job appealing.
<br> </br>
To gain this position I would need to be well versed in various programming
languages, being able to communicate well with people around the world and a
dedicated work ethic to meet the requirements of eac job.
<br> </br>
Right now I am sadly not well versed in the programming language and I can only
communicate well in my native language. Therefore it is important for me to
learn the programming language and work on my communication skills.
<br> </br>
Currently enrolled in RMIT courses I intend to learn the programming language
and other things needed of me to be in any IT profession.

My personality is Advocate INFJ-T
My online learning style is Visual.
In the five big personality test I scored
</b>
<ol>
  <li> Openness = 81 % </li>
  <li> Conscientiousness = 69 % </li>
  <li> Extraversion = 40 % </li>
  <li> Agreeableness = 52 % </li>
  <li> Neuroticism = 56 % </li>
</ol>
The results of these tests tell me that I work best in groups when I can see the
questions and objects. I am open and agreeable to suggestions, so I am flexible
to work alongside. In making a team I should work alongside people who are
like minded.

<h1><font color="green"> Program development </h1>
<p>
  <b>Overview</b>
  <br> </br>
  I would like to create a mobile app that calculates how much calories
  ingredients have and contain a self updating library of recipes .
  It would be convenient app for people who are watching their diets, are
  working towards a healthy life or preparing for a physical event. Due to it
  being a mobile app it can be used on the go where people can calculate their
  daily caloric intake when eating at home or outside. The app's purpose is for
  the user to be able to plan their diets for weeks in advance and when it’s
  best to have cheat days.
  <br> </br>
  <b>Motivation</b>
  <br> </br>
  There are a large number of mobile apps in the mobile market each with their
  own purpose. However, the ones that are most well known have nothing to do
  with calculating calories and cooking. Recently I have been into cooking and
  planning my own diet but the apps I have found did not offer all the features
  I want, so I had to use multiple apps. So one of the key motivations was to
  make my own app where I can add in all the features I want. In the 21st
  century health is a good trend so I believe there will be a good market
    for my app.
  <br> </br>
  <b>Description</b>
  <br> </br>
  The app will first have an index of ingredients with an estimated calorie
  count and be able to help the user calculate the total amount of calories for
  each meal. This will be one of its key features allowing the app to be
  flexible, if the user wants to cook something and is not following a recipe.
  They can just enter a list of ingredients and how they intend to cook them
  into the app such as pan fry with oil, oven bake or boil. I am hopeful this
  will help people like myself who are busy most of the time so at times when
  we cook tend to just use available ingredients in the fridge to put together
  a makeshift meal. This feature will however be difficult to implement if the
  users are using leftovers from another meal but an estimate can be calculated.
  In addition to this feature, I wish to add in a library or recipes that can be
  customised to suit the tastes and needs of each individual customer. This can
  be accomplished by using an algorithm to monitor the users go to ingredients
  and recipes then using the information gathered to allow the app to make
  suggestions on it’s own. Another option is to allow the users to go through
  an optional survey which will help them customise their own dietary options.
  Due to how the average consumer has a minimal attention span when using mobile
  apps, it is best to leave the survey as optional.
  <br> </br>
  <b>Tools and Technologies</b>
  <br> </br>
  At first I think would need to create a graphic template, design then using
  Xcode and Swift. As it is a mobile app I would need to use the app store as
  the platform to sell it. Utilizing the computer at home, I believe it will be
  enough to create a simple prototype of the app and open source tools such as
  Eclipse the tool that I am learning to use in another unit at RMIT. A hard
  drive or online server to contain all the data on the project will be a
  necessary investment containing backup files in case of emergencies.
  <br> </br>
  <b>Skills Required</b>
  <br> </br>
  Firstly I would need Cross platform development skills as I would need the
  knowledge to alter the app to work on iOS, Android and Blackberry to reach a
  larger audience. UX/UI development skills are needed to make sure the app
  appears appealing to customers. A firm grasp on in modern programing language
  such as HTML5 and Java is a necessity and thankfully RMIT teaches their
  students these languages. A degree in computer science or something similar
  would help in convincing people that the app was made by a professional and
  as a student at RMIT I would eventually get one when I graduate.
  <br> </br>
  <b>Outcome</b>
  <br> </br>
  I want this app to have an impact on the health concerned and food mobile app
  users and to generate a follower base. Then generate additional revenue ask
  to receive sponsorship from some companies such as Blue apron who deliver
  food and instructions on how to cook them. This is my first app, so it is
  bound to have faults and mistakes so the best thing I can hope for is for it
  be well received and then get feedback which I can then use to improve the
  app itself and as a learning step in my future projects.
